# MCP Inspector

The MCP inspector is a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers.

It can be run easily from `npx`. For example, in a folder where there's a built JavaScript server at `build/index.js`:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector build/index.js
```

You can also pass arguments along to the server:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector build/index.js arg1 arg2 ...
```
